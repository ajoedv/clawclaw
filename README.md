## UX

### **Strategy**

Due to the need to find a family to adopt Sylvester. with Considering Selvester's past suffering with his ex-family. and because of the unfair and painful clipping of the cat's claws, and depriving cats of the natural benefits of the claws.
After speaking closely with Sylvester we decided to show how the claws can be valuable in love and in protection, and what Sylvester has skills and how these skills benefit his new family, with very specific site content, and focus on these points:
1. Showing the history of cats in protecting humans for more than 3100 years ago, 365 days a year.
2. showing the benefit by making Sylvester a member of the family and clearfy his skils.
3. Ability for families to contact Sylvester Connect with Sylvester and adopt him
4. showing some of Sylvester's photos in the site.

To decide on features, design and technologies to use in this project, I first focused on the target user:
- Aged 10-80
- Cat lovers
- individuals or families
- People that have problems with mice rats in their homes
- opponents to clipping Cat's claws
- People who value the relationship with pets
- people who believe cats can make mental health better
- who need cats massage

After research into the specified target group the resulte tells these users would need to:

- Clean, modern and inspiring design
- Relevant and easily understood information
- Social Media links for follow up information
- easy way to contact

### **Scope**

Based on the previous points, we settled on the following features for the site:

- Header with a Clawclaw logo and navigation menu for easy access  to each page and section on site.
- big Hero Image of Selvester showing his beauty.
- Sylvester name and his title.
- information about history of cats and personal information about Sylvester.
- photo of Sylvester when his sleeping.
- the benifits of adopting Sylvester and what are his skills.
- contact form for users to connect with Sylvester and send thier interest of adopting him.

### **Structure**

Due to the simplicity of the site's purpose and importance, the site will be a single Page website. and this page will divided into 4 different sections.

![Skeleton Design](docs/images/design-skeleton.png)

I created design on Adobe Illustrator for the project which being followed by 95%. this design explain the skeleton of the site and in same time it is make the surface plane clear as a final product.

### **Design**
In color psychology, black color meaning is symbolic of mystery, power, elegance, and sophistication. In contrast, the color meaning can also evoke emotions such as sadness and anger.
And also Some positive emotions associated with yellow include happiness, excitement, originality, enthusiasm, confidence, hope, and creativity. Negative feelings connected to yellow are cowardice, illness, caution, betrayal, egotism, and anxiety.
Using black and yellow together means that any negative connotations of either color can be counteracted. Yellow color will be balanced out by the elegance of black. On the other hand, black can balanced out by the cheer and warmth from yellow. Also, the contrast of black and yellow makes the site and the logo pop and grab attention without seeming too loud or annoyingly bright.
